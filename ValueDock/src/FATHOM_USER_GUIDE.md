## 🚀 How to Enter Meeting Information Manually

Since the automatic Fathom import isn't currently available, here's how to quickly add meeting information to your presentations:

### Step 1: Access Your Fathom Data

1. Go to **https://app.fathom.video**
2. Log in to your account
3. Find meetings with your target customer company

### Step 2: Review Meeting Summaries

Fathom creates AI summaries of your meetings. Review these to gather:
- Key discussion points
- Meeting dates and participants
- Business goals mentioned
- Problems/challenges discussed
- Desired outcomes

### Step 3: Enter Meeting History

**In ValueDock:**

1. Go to **Presentation Screen**
2. Scroll to **Executive Summary** section
3. Find the **Meeting History** field
4. Type or paste your meeting summary

**Example format:**
```
We've held 4 meetings with Acme Corporation over the past 3 months:

• January 15, 2024 - Initial discovery call with John Smith (CTO) 
  and Sarah Johnson (VP Operations). Discussed challenges with 
  current manual processes and desire to automate repetitive tasks.

• February 2, 2024 - Technical deep-dive with IT team. Reviewed 
  existing systems and integration requirements.

• February 20, 2024 - Executive presentation to CEO Michael Brown.
  Covered business case and projected ROI.

  Finalized requirements and timeline.
```

### Step 4: Add Goals (Optional)

**In ValueDock:**

1. Scroll to **Goals** section
2. Click **"Add Goal"** button
3. For each goal discussed in meetings:
   - Enter the **description** (e.g., "Reduce manual data entry by 80%")
   - Enter the **target outcome** (e.g., "Save 32 hours per week")
   - System automatically aligns goals with your outcomes

**Example goals from meetings:**
- "Improve customer response time to under 2 hours"
- "Reduce error rates by 50%"
- "Automate invoice processing"
- "Achieve 99.9% system uptime"

### Step 5: Add Challenges (Optional)

**In ValueDock:**

3. For each challenge discussed in meetings:
   - Enter the **description** (e.g., "Manual data entry taking 40 hours/week")
   - Enter the **impact** (e.g., "High error rates, customer complaints")
   - System automatically aligns challenges with your outcomes

**Example challenges from meetings:**
- "Legacy systems don't integrate with modern tools"
- "Team spending too much time on repetitive tasks"
- "High employee turnover due to boring manual work"
- "Frequent errors in data entry causing downstream issues"
